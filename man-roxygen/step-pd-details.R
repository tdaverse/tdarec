#' @details
#' Persistent homology (PH) is a tool of algebraic topology to extract features
#' from data whose _persistence_ measures their robustness to scale. The
#' computation relies on a sequence of maps between discrete topological spaces
#' (usually a filtration comprising only inclusions) constructed from the data.
