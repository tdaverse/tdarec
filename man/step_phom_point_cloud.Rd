\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables for this step.
See \code{\link[recipes:selections]{selections()}} for more details.}

\item{role}{For model terms created by this step, what analysis role should
they be assigned? By default, the new columns created by this step from the
original variables will be used as \emph{predictors} in a model.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
been estimated.}

\item{filtration}{The type of filtration from which to compute persistent
homology; one of \code{"Rips"}, \code{"Vietoris"} (equivalent), or \code{"alpha"}.}

\item{max_hom_degree, radius_max, diameter_max, field_order}{Parameters passed to persistence engines.}

\item{engine}{The computational engine to use (see 'Details'). Reasonable
defaults are chosen based on \code{filtration}.}

\item{columns}{A character string of the selected variable names. This field
is a placeholder and will be populated once \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep()}} is used.}

\item{keep_original_cols}{A logical to keep the original variables in the
output. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
\code{\link[recipes:bake]{bake()}}? While all operations are baked when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep()}} is run, some
operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g. processing the
outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it
may affect the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step added to the
sequence of any existing operations.
}
\description{
The function \code{step_phom_point_cloud()} creates a \emph{specification}
of a recipe step that will convert compatible data formats (distance
matrices, coordinate matrices, or time series) to 3-column matrix
representations of persistence diagram data. The input and output must be
list-columns.
}
\details{
Persistent homology (PH) is a tool of algebraic topology to extract features
from data whose \emph{persistence} measures their robustness to scale. The
computation relies on a sequence of maps between discrete topological spaces
(usually a filtration comprising only inclusions) constructed from the data.
}
\section{PH of Point Clouds}{


The PH of a point cloud arises from a simplicial filtration (usually
Vietoris--Rips, ÄŒech, or alpha) along an increasing distance threshold.

Ripser is a highly efficient implementation of PH on a point cloud (a
finite metric space) via the Vietoris--Rips filtration and is ported to R
through \code{\link[ripserr:ripserr]{ripserr}}. \code{\link[TDA:TDA-package]{TDA}}
calls the Dionysus, PHAT, and GUDHI libraries to compute PH via
Vietoris--Rips and alpha filtrations. The \code{filtration} parameter controls
the choice of filtration while the \code{engine} parameter allows the user to
manually select an implementation.

Both engines accept data sets in distance matrix, coordinate matrix, and
data frame formats. While \strong{ripserr} computes PH for time series data,
this is not currently supported in \strong{tdarec}.

The \code{max_hom_degree} argument determines the highest-dimensional features
to be calculated. Either \code{diameter_max} (preferred) or \code{radius_max} can be
used to bound the distance threshold along which PH is computed. The
\code{field_order} argument should be prime and will be the order of the field
of coefficients used in the computation. In most applications, only
\code{max_hom_degree} will be tuned, and to at most \code{3L}.

\section{Tuning Parameters}{


This step has 1 tuning parameter(s):
