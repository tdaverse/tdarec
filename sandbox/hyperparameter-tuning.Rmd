This vignette will illustrate the tuning of hyperparameters at two pre-processing steps provided by {tdarec}: the computation of persistent homology from data, and the vectorization of the resulting persistence data.
The vignette will be updated as additional hyperparameters become available.

```{r setup}
library(tidymodels)
library(tdarec)

## Point cloud sampling

Persistent homology is not strictly a topological property; by design, it is sensitive to the geometric scales at which certain features can or cannot be detected.
And the same topological space may embed in numerous ways in a finite-dimensional real space.
{tdaunif} provides multiple embeddings of the genus-1 torus, for example.
So, how much does the geometry of the embedding affect its persistent homology?

We will test whether a simple predictive model can correctly classify point clouds from the same topological space based on which embedding they were sampled from.
Below we use two embeddings of the Klein bottle into $\mathbb{R}^4$, known as the "flat" embedding and the "tube" embedding, which differ in whether the resulting manifold is locally curved.
We generate 48 samples of size 60, each from a randomly selected embedding, and perturb the sample with Gaussian noise.
The point clouds are stored as a list-column in a tibble together with the label for their source embedding.

```{r toy data set}
set.seed(as.Date("2024-11-16"))
tibble(embedding = sample(c("flat", "tube"), size = 48, replace = TRUE)) |> 
  mutate(sample = lapply(embedding, function(emb) {
    switch(
      emb,
      flat = tdaunif::sample_klein_flat(60, sd = .5),
      tube = tdaunif::sample_klein_tube(60, sd = .5)
    )
  })) |> 
  mutate(embedding = factor(embedding)) |> 
  print() -> klein_data
```

The task is now to build a model to classify each point cloud according to its embedding.
We will optimize both pre-processing and model hyperparameters within a training set using 3-fold cross-validation and evaluate the final model on a testing set.

```{r data partitions}
klein_split <- initial_split(klein_data, prop = .8)
klein_train <- training(klein_split)
klein_test <- testing(klein_split)
klein_folds <- vfold_cv(klein_train, v = 3L)
```

For this recipe, we perform only two pre-processing steps: We compute the Vietoris--Rips persistent homology of each point cloud, then we vectorize each resulting persistence diagram to its Euler characteristic curve.
Because multiple hyperparameters might be called "degree"---especially where homology is involved---we give the explicit name `"vr_degree"` to the Vietoris--Rips parameter.
To preserve space, we remove the original columns at each step.

```{r persistent homological recipe}
scale_seq <- seq(0, 3, by = .05)
recipe(embedding ~ sample, data = klein_train) |> 
  step_pd_point_cloud(sample, max_hom_degree = tune("vr_degree")) |> 
  step_vpd_euler_characteristic_curve(sample, xseq = scale_seq) |> 
  print() -> klein_rec
```

We can check which hyperparameters are primed to be tuned by extracting the dials from the recipe:

```{r tunable hyperparameters}
extract_parameter_set_dials(klein_rec)
```

Because the vectorization yields numerous features, each of which may contribute incrementally to model performance, we will build a random forest classifier, the most common type of ensemble model.

One tuning parameter, the number of variables sampled for each split (`mtry`), depends on the dimensionality of the pre-processed data.
To provide it with a tuning range, we first pre-process the data using the largest candidate homological degree:

```{r}
klein_rec |> 
  finalize_recipe(list(vr_degree = 3)) |> 
  prep() |> 
  bake(new_data = klein_train) ->
  klein_bake
mtry_param <- finalize(mtry(), klein_bake |> select(contains("euler")))
degree_param <- finalize(max_hom_degree(), klein_bake |> select(sample))
```

We can now specify the model and its tunable parameters.
In anticipation of the optimization process, we can also check its dials.

```{r random forest model}
rand_forest(
  trees = 500,
  min_n = tune("rf_node"),
  mtry = tune("rf_pred")
) |> 
  set_mode("classification") |> 
  set_engine("randomForest") |> 
  print() -> klein_spec
extract_parameter_set_dials(klein_spec)
```

Since the persistent homology computation in particular can be time-intensive, we will take a page from Motta &al (2019) and use Bayesian optimization to tune our hyperparameters.
<!--FIXME: When `objective = "<some metric>"` is set, the following error is invariable:
Error in UseMethod("predict") : 
  no applicable method for 'predict' applied to an object of class "character"
-->

```{r bayesian optimization}
klein_rec_end <- klein_rec |> step_select(embedding, contains("euler"))
klein_res <- tune_bayes(
  klein_spec,
  preprocessor = klein_rec_end,
  resamples = klein_folds,
  param_info = parameters(list(
    vr_degree = degree_param,
    rf_node = min_n(), rf_pred = mtry_param
  )),
  metrics = metric_set(accuracy, roc_auc),
  iter = 6, initial = 6
)
collect_metrics(klein_res)
(klein_param <- select_best(klein_res, metric = "roc_auc"))
```

Across several initializations and iterations, we obtain `r nrow(filter(collect_metrics(klein_res), .metric == "accuracy"))` hyperparameter setting sets.
We use the best of these to fit the recipe and model to the entire training set to obtain the final model.

```{r final model fit}
klein_fin <- prep(finalize_recipe(klein_rec_end, klein_param))
fit(
  finalize_model(klein_spec, klein_param),
  formula(klein_fin),
  data = bake(klein_fin, new_data = klein_train)
) |> 
  print() -> klein_fit
```

Finally, we evaluate the final model on the holdout data from the original partition.

```{r}
klein_fit |> 
  predict(new_data = bake(klein_fin, new_data = klein_test)) |> 
  bind_cols(select(klein_test, embedding)) |> 
  accuracy(truth = embedding, estimate = .pred_class)
```
