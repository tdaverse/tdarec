# tdarec 0.1.1

This patch debugs the vectorization tests, which had failed to run due to a prefix in the names of the generated test files.
Once corrected, the tent template functions step failed one test due to missing parameters; this has been corrected.

# tdarec 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
